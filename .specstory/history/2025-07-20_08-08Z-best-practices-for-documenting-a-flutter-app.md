# Best practices for documenting a Flutter app (2025-07-20 08:08Z)

_**User**_

in flutter, suppose i want to create a .md file where i describe what i want the application to do , what's the best practice in doing this in a flutter-like repo? (i.e., where to store such file, what to name it , how to structure it, etc) #websearch

_**Assistant**_

Based on my research of Flutter project documentation best practices, here's the recommended approach for creating a markdown file to describe your Flutter application:

## **File Location and Naming**

### **Primary Options:**

1. **`README.md`** (Root level) - **Most Common**
   - Place at the root of your Flutter project
   - This is the standard approach and what most developers expect
   - Automatically displayed on GitHub/GitLab repositories

2. **`docs/` folder approach** - **For Complex Projects**
   - Create a `docs/` folder at the root level
   - Use files like:
     - `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
     - `docs/SPECIFICATIONS.md` 
     - `docs/FEATURES.md`
     - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## **Recommended Structure for Your Description File**

```markdown
# [Your App Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what your application does

## Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- What the app must do
- User interactions
- Business logic

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Platform support (iOS/Android)
- UI/UX requirements

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

## Technical Specifications
- Flutter version
- Target platforms
- Key dependencies
- Architecture patterns

## Installation & Setup
How to run the project

## Contributing
Guidelines for other developers
```

## **Best Practices:**

1. **Start with README.md** - Use this for the main application description
2. **Create additional docs/** files for detailed specifications if needed
3. **Keep it updated** - Maintain the documentation as your app evolves
4. **Use clear headings** - Make it easy to navigate
5. **Include visual aids** - Screenshots, diagrams, or mockups when helpful

## **Recommended Approach:**

For most Flutter projects, start with a comprehensive **`README.md`** at the root level. If your project becomes complex with multiple stakeholders or detailed requirements, then create a `docs/` folder with specialized files like `REQUIREMENTS.md` or `SPECIFICATIONS.md`.

This follows the standard Flutter community practices and makes your project easily understandable to other developers.

Great! 

well then in that case, I want you to generate the text that i'll paste into a docs/project_requirements.md and another one for a docs/features.md file, where the logic of what i want to accomplish is the following:

the application takes:
* an audio file of a surah in the Quran
* the ayah timestamps of the given audio (i.e., when each ayah was said)
* optionally, the word timestamps of the given audio

Then, the UI should enable the following:

* Play the audio via an audio progress bar (which looks like a waveform)
* When the audio plays, it displays the current timestamp while playing + the current ayah 
* if the word timestamps file is provided, it also highlights/dims the displayed word according to the current timestamp being played by the user via the waveform bar

All of the above requirements were regarding the "audio player" part of the app. Next, we discuss the requirements for the annotation part:

there are 3 options for adjusting (i.e., annotating) the timestamp files:

option 1: the user uploads a timestamps file that contains the correct ayah timestamps , then the ayah timestamps details initially rendered in the UI will now get replaced with the new timestamps (we will later add the option to extract the timestamps file from a YouTube video for which the user sends the URL)

option 2: The user adjusts the ayah timestamps: in that case, we want to display a couple of things below the player (while the audio is playing):

* A list of cards, where each card shows:
    * the number of the ayah
    * the start/end timestamps of the ayah
    * 2 small icons next to these timestamps that, when pressed, will seek the waveform_bar to the start/end timestamp respectively
    * An icon indicating whether or not the user has already reviewed this timestamp or not
    * if the audio player's current timestamp falls between the start/end timestamp of the card, then the card's background color should light up slightly.
* a button above that "list of cards" that says: "Sync to Ayah" , that when pressed, will  keep displaying the card of the currently played ayah until the user scrolls in that list or clicks the button that now says (Unsync)

Now, another feature should be added to the waveform bar: Add on top of the waveform 2 long thin draggable bars representing the start/end timestamps of the ayah currently being played, such that if the user drags one of them , then a new button will be rendered next to the "sync to Ayah" button called "Change Timestamp" that when pressed, will change the timestamp in the corresponding ayah card. but take care of this corner case: if the new timestamp overlaps with a timestamp of the preceding/following ayah, then that ayah's overlaped timestamp should be changed as well to barely not overlap. In addition , when that "Change Timestamp" button is pressed, the card's reviewed icon (mentioned previously) should be now replaced to indicate that the card got reviewed.

Alternatively, the user could:
* click on the start/end timestamp in the card to make it editable, 
* then type the new timestamp(s), 
* then click "Change Timestamps" 
* then we do the same outcomes discussed above, but in addition , we move the 2 thin bars of the waveform accordingly

Side note: The user could change multiple ayahs' timestamps, not just 1 ayah, THEN click on "Change Timestamps", so the code should sort by the ayah number to iterate over the changes stored in the cache and apply them in the correct order


Now finally, for option 3, it will be very similar to the logic discussed in option 2, but with slight changes, so for now, just state that these requirements will be decided later once we get an initial version of the application running

I'll create two comprehensive documentation files for your Quranic audio annotation application.

````markdown
# Surah Annotator - Project Requirements

## Project Overview

The Surah Annotator is a Flutter application designed to facilitate the precise annotation and adjustment of Quranic audio timestamps. The application combines audio playback with visual feedback and intuitive editing tools to help users accurately align Quranic text with corresponding audio segments.

## Core Inputs

### Required Inputs
- **Audio File**: A complete Surah recording in standard audio formats (MP3, WAV, etc.)

#### 2.3 Option 3: Advanced Adjustment Features
- **FR-2.3.1**: Requirements to be defined after initial version completion
- **FR-2.3.2**: Will build upon Option 2 functionality with enhancements

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- **NFR-9**: Prevent data loss during editing operations

## Technical Constraints

- **TC-1**: Built using Flutter framework for cross-platform compatibility
- **TC-2**: Must support both Android and iOS platforms
- **TC-3**: Audio processing must work with standard audio formats
- **TC-4**: Timestamp files must use standardized format (JSON/CSV)

## Success Criteria

1. Users can load and play Quranic audio with synchronized text display
2. Timestamp adjustments are intuitive and conflict-free
3. All changes can be saved and exported for future use
4. Application maintains performance with large audio files
5. User workflow is efficient for bulk timestamp corrections
